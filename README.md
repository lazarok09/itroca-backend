# Welcome to my first Swagger e-commerce API

## About üïµÔ∏è
Have you noticed that almost all front-end engineer gets bored with they stack? I believe is that what makes everybody to inovate and create a new stuff from scratch, like the ton of javascript libraries available.

That was kind of my case. I needed to learn more about some topics like CORS, cookies and raw auth. 

At my early begins i skipped a lot of stuff to get into what i needed to find a job. After a while, i decided to create a back-end with a nice docs and use that as a way to programing outside my job and grow my fullstack skills. 

As a admireer of things done without IA and Youtube, i had ton of fun reading all docs i founded and get a lot frustated when my cookies was not being sended to my client-side. LOL all i needed was to fetch with **credentials ** but i know that now :D

I hope you enjoy this journey and remember, those who can still learn somenthing new, even when they think they know enough, are the best people to have around.
